# Note
The application is not fully complete and functional. Due to time constraints, I was unable to fully complete all the features as planned. Additionally, I had to balance this project with other university commitments, which impacted the time available to finalize everything. Despite this, I put in significant effort to develop the core functionality, and I hope the work demonstrates my skills and dedication.I would appreciate if you could consider giving me a LOR, acknowledging my effort and growth during this period.
